Hi!
Christian Blanton
I'm Christian, and I have a passion for creating games. Currently, I am a student studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Games at the University of Southern California.
Aside from playing and creating videogames, I enjoy playing basketball, working out, and classical music.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
